## ⭐️ Motivation
I created this project for "The Odin Project" course. The motivation was to put into practice what I have studied and verify my skills.
This was the first "real programming" project, so it was very exciting but also difficult. I've run into quite a few problems, but being able to solve them was a great satisfaction.
